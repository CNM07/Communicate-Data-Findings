## by Njeri Macharia


## Dataset

> Ford GoBike is a regional public bike sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. This dataset includes information about individual rides made on bike-sharing system. Ford GoBike, now known as Bay Wheels, was established in 2013 as Bay Area Bike Share and re-launched in 2017 as Ford GoBike. As of January 2018, the Bay Wheels system had about 10,000 annual subscribers, over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose.


## Summary of Findings

> Most people who used the service were subscribers rather than customers. More males used the service than females. The average age of users of the service was 34 with most users being young, mostly between 23 and 38 years old. Majority of the trips were short ones, between 5 and 20 minutes. Thursday is the most popular day for the service. 8.00 a.m and 5:00 p.m are the busiest times of the day for use of the bike service and 3.00 a.m the least popular time.
> Customers of the service seem to have longer riding time than subsribers. Females and Other genders have longer riding times than males. The weekends is when users take the longest rides, up to 13 minutes. Subscribers have higher use for this service and especially on Thursdays. Subscribers seem to be older than Customers. Riders who rented bikes during the weekdays are older. Over the weekends, younger people use the service more.
> Customers tend to travel for longer durations than subscribers. Both customers and subscribers use the service for longer durations on the weekends. Customers generally have longer durations throughout all hours of the day than subscribers.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For me, the main purpose of the analysis was to investigate user characteristics i.e. 'who uses the service the most' and to also look at the duration of the rides and when the service was most in use. I also wanted to observe how these variables interact with each other.

> I found that among user types, subscribers used the service more than customers did. This should be typical and therefore were not surprising results. Among the three genders listed, Male users used the service a lot more than users of the two other genders.
> I also found that the most popular day of use of the service is Thursday as most people begin and end their trips on this day. This is closely followed by Tuesday. The least popular days for use of the service are Sunday and Saturday. The most popular times of use of the service are 8:00 a.m and 5:00 p.m. The peak use of service at these times is likely caused by people heading to the office in the morning and leaving for home in the evenings. 
> I found it interesting that although Sunday and Saturday are the least popular days of use for this service, the longest bike rides are taken on Sunday and Saturday.
> Another interesting insight was that customers of 'other' gender took longer bike rides than any other group, even though subscribers and males, as we have earlier seen, use the service way more.
